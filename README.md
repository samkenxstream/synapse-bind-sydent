# Bind 3PIDs to Sydent

A module that leverages Sydent's internal bind APIs to automatically record 3PIDs
association on a Sydent instance once it's been verified on the local Synapse homeserver.

This module works with Synapse v1.78.0 and above.

## Installation

From the virtual environment that you use for Synapse, install this module with:
```shell
pip install path/to/synapse-bind-sydent
```
(If you run into issues, you may need to upgrade `pip` first, e.g. by running
`pip install --upgrade pip`)

Then alter your homeserver configuration, adding to your `modules` configuration:
```yaml
modules:
  - module: synapse_bind_sydent.SydentBinder
    config:
      # The base URL (protocol + hostname or address) of the Sydent instance to bind to.
      # Must be reachable by Synapse.
      # Required.
      sydent_base_url: https://example.com
```


## Development

In a virtual environment with pip ≥ 21.1, run
```shell
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

To run the unit tests, you can either use:
```shell
tox -e py
```
or
```shell
trial tests
```

To run the linters and `mypy` type checker, use `./scripts-dev/lint.sh`.


## Releasing

The exact steps for releasing will vary; but this is an approach taken by the
Synapse developers (assuming a Unix-like shell):

 1. Set a shell variable to the version you are releasing (this just makes
    subsequent steps easier):
    ```shell
    version=X.Y.Z
    ```

 2. Update `setup.cfg` so that the `version` is correct.

 3. Stage the changed files and commit.
    ```shell
    git add -u
    git commit -m v$version -n
    ```

 4. Push your changes.
    ```shell
    git push
    ```

 5. When ready, create a signed tag for the release:
    ```shell
    git tag -s v$version
    ```
    Base the tag message on the changelog.

 6. Push the tag.
    ```shell
    git push origin tag v$version
    ```
